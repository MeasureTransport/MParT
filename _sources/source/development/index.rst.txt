Building the Documentation
---------------------------

1. Make sure doxygen, sphinx, breathe, and the pydata-sphinx-theme are installed.  This is easily done with anaconda:

.. code-block::

   conda install -c conda-forge doxygen sphinx breathe pydata-sphinx-theme
   pip install sphinx-panels

2. If working in a conda environment, add dependency paths to conf.py

3. Build the :code:`sphinx` target:

.. code-block::

    cd build
    cmake ..
    make sphinx

4. Open the sphinx output

.. code-block::

    open docs/sphinx/index.html
