Measure transport and MParT
-------------
Measure transport is a rich area in applied mathematics that constructs deterministic transformations--known as transport maps--between 
random variables [1]. These maps characterize a complex target distribution as a transformation of a simple reference 
distribution (e.g., a standard Gaussian). In the context of probabilistic modeling, transport maps enable sampling from the 
target distribution and the evaluation of its probability density function. Monotone triangular maps are one class of transport maps that have 
several computational advantages over non-triangular maps and provide a building block for the normalizing flows architectures commonly used 
in the machine learning community [2]. Triangular maps are also well suited for many tasks in Bayesian inference, 
including the modeling of conditional distributions [3] and the acceleration of posterior sampling 
[4, 5, 6, 7]. 

In practice, working with triangular maps requires the definition of a parameterized family of multivariate monotone functions 
and particular computations to enable map optimization. 

Several existing software packages have the ability to parameterize monotone functions such as TransportMaps [8], ATM [9], and MUQ [10]. 

The Monotone Parameterization Toolkit (`MParT`), pronounced "em-par-tee", is a 
C++ library (with bindings to Python, Julia, and Matlab) that aims to provide performance portable implementations of such parameterizations that can be used to accelerate higher level packages like TransportMaps, ATM, and MUQ that cannot currently leverage GPU resources.
MParT emphasizes fast execution and parsimonious parameterizations that can permit near real-time computation on low and moderate dimensional 
problems.
